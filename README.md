There are a lot of machine CNC machine manufacturers around the world. Each of these machines has a unique style of NC code. Due to this it is not the easiest to picture what the code is trying to do. In some situations it may be important to see the expected behavior versus what the machine is actually doing to determine where any miscuts happen. Currently this is just supporting 2D cutting machines. Things like punch, bevel, and subprograms are intended to be supported to better handle all machine types.
